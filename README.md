# Learning Urban Perception of Cities via Street View Images
- This project is an effort for my final year project in university, currently I am not actively developing this project but I am trying to extend the project using Tensorflow.js for active client-side urban prediction given an area.

- The Pipeline of Data Preprocessing to Visualising is in the src folder.

- Download the weight file from the trained model [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HIy3pvJ3_a5RxLcuilXazWAYJTBVyWeU). For prediction of new GSV images, set the path of the weight and run all cells in `"src/Training/pedict.ipynb"`

- To check out the web-based visualisation, clone the directory `"src/Web Visualisation"` and download the KL_GSV images from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F70rrxQ_MIAaTMxh9-CTY5jAw-VbpX57) and save the KL_GSV images into the `"src/Web Visualisation/KL_GSV"` directory.

Note: MMU Gmail is required to get access to download the weight and images.
